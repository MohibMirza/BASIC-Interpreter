HOW TO USE:

Put your BASIC code into a txt file. Format each line like this:

<LINE> <COMMAND>

ex. 
1 PRINT ((1+21)/7)
2 GOTO 20
3 LET X 5
20 END

RUN MAKE AND TYPE ./interpreter <FILE> TO EXECUTE THE CODE!

COMMAND LOGIC:

PRINT <NUM> - PRINTS A NUMERIC EXPRESSION'S VALUE
LET <VAR> <NUM> - STORES VALUE OF NUM'S VALUE INTO VAR
LET <VAR> [<NUM1>] <NUM2> - STORES NUM2'S VALUE AT NUM1 INDEX OF ARRAY VAR
GOTO <LINENO> - JUMPS TO THIS LINENO IN CODE. (LINE NUMBERS ARE FORMATTED BEFORE EACH COMMAND)
IF <BOOL> THEN <LINE> - IF BOOL IS TRUE, IT WILL JUMP TO LINE, IF NOT THE CODE CONTINUES CHRONOLOGICALLY
GOSUB <LINENO> - JUMPS TO LINENO AND RETURNS BACK TO THIS LINE ONCE IT HITS AN END STATEMENT (CAN BE USED FOR RECURSION! :D)
END - TERMINATES PROGRAM. IF WITHIN A GOSUB, THEN JUMPS BACK TO THE GOSUB.
